##### Code is written using Github CodeSpaces and deployed using gh-pages.
##### Written using React.js and Typescript
##### React-Router is used to implement Routing
##### JsonData is copied to datasource.tsx file from document provided by recruiter
##### For Styling and Responsiveness purpose React-Bootstrap is used
##### I'm confused on Sorting title column, so used string localeCompare method for title column
##### Initially thought of using State Management like Context.API or Redux, but there is less nesting of components so relied on prop-drilling
##### For sorting icons on columns font-awesome icons are used.
